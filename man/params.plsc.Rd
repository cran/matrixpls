\arguments{
  \item{S}{Covariance matrix of the data.}

  \item{W}{Weight matrix, where the indicators are on
  colums and composites are on the rows.}

  \item{fm}{factoring method for estimating the corrected
  factor loadings. \code{"dijkstra"} will use the
  correction presented by Dijkstra (2011), where the PLS
  estimates of the factor loadings for a latent variable
  are multiplied with a scalar \code{a}, which is
  calculated by a simple formula that approximately
  minimizes squared residual covariances of the factor
  model. \code{minres}, \code{wls}, \code{gls}, \code{pa},
  and \code{ml} will use a factor analysis and passing this
  parameter through to \code{\link[psych]{fa}}.}

  \item{model}{There are two options for this argument: 1.
  lavaan script or lavaan parameter table, or 2. a list
  containing three matrices \code{inner},
  \code{reflective}, and \code{formative} defining the free
  regression paths in the model.}

  \item{...}{All other arguments are passed through to
  \code{matrixpls.weights} and \code{parameterEstimator}.}

\description{
  Estimates the model parameters with an adapted version of
  Dijkstra's (2011) PLSc. The parameters between latent
  variables are estimated using two-stages least squares
  estimation using a composite covariance matrix that has
  been disattenuated with estimated composite
  reliabilities.
}
\details{
  \code{params.plsc} estimates the statistical model
  described by \code{model} with the following steps. If
  \code{model} is not in the native format, it is converted
  to the native format containing matrices \code{inner},
  \code{reflective}, and \code{formative}. The weights
  \code{W} and the data covariance matrix \code{S} are used
  to calculate the composite covariance matrix \code{C} and
  the indicator-composite covariance matrix \code{IC}.

  \code{C} is then disattenuated. The reliability estimates
  used in the dissattenuation process are calculated by
  using Dijkstra's (2011) correction or with a separate
  factor analysis for each indicator block. Indicators that
  are used in a composite but are not specified as
  reflective indicators for the latent variable that the
  composite approximates are assumed to be perfectly
  reliable.

  The disattenuated \code{C} is used to estimate the the
  inner part of the model with separate OLS regressions in
  the same way as in \code{\link{params.regression}}. This
  differs from Dijkstra's (2011) PLSc estimator that uses
  2SLS. The reason for not using 2SLS is that PLS is
  commonly used with models that do not contain variables
  that could be used as instruments in the 2SLS estimation.

  The results from the disattenuation process are used as
  estimates of the \code{reflective} part of the model and
  the \code{formative} part of the model estimated with
  separate OLS regressions using the \code{S} and \code{IC}
  matrices.

  Those elements of teh indicator-composite covariance
  matrix \code{IC} that correspond to factor loadings are
  replaced with the factor loading estimates.

  The dissattenuation code for Dijkstra's method is adapted
  from Huang (2013), which is based on Dijkstra (2011).
