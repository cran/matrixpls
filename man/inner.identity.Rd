\title{PLS inner estimation with the identity scheme}
\usage{
  inner.identity(S, W, inner.mod, ...)
}
\arguments{
  \item{S}{Covariance matrix of the data.}

  \item{W}{Weight matrix, where the indicators are on
  colums and composites are on the rows.}

  \item{inner.mod}{A square matrix specifying the
  relationships of the composites in the model.}

  \item{...}{Other parameters are ignored}
}
\value{
  A matrix of unscaled inner weights \code{E} with the same
  dimesions as \code{inner.mod}.
}
\description{
  Returns a set of inner weights using the identity scheme.
}
\details{
  This scheme is not commonly discussed in the current PLS
  literature, but it is a special case that is analyzed in
  the early PLS literature and currently implemented in at
  least the WarpPLS software. In the identity scheme
  identity matrix is used as the inner weight matrix
  \code{E}.

  The identity scheme with Mode A outer estimation
  converges toward the first principal component of each
  indicator block.
