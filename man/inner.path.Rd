\title{PLS inner estimation with the path scheme}
\usage{
inner.path(S, W, inner.mod, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{S}{Covariance matrix of the data.}

\item{W}{Weight matrix, where the indicators are on colums and composites are on the rows.}

\item{inner.mod}{A square matrix specifying the relationships of the composites in the model.}

\item{...}{Other parameters are ignored}
}
\description{
Calculates a set of inner weights based on the path scheme.
}
\details{
In the path scheme, inner weights are based on regression estimates of the relationships between
composites that are connected in the model specified in \code{inner.mod}, and correlations for
the inverse relationships. If a relationship is reciprocal, regression is used for both directions.

Falls back to to identity scheme for composites that are not connected to any other composites.
