convCheck.square(Wnew, Wold)
}

\item{Wnew}{Current weight matrix}

\item{Wold}{Weight matrix from the previous iteration}

}
\description{
Compares two weight matrices and returns the value of the square difference
convergence criterion.
}

Squared difference convergence criterion is the maximum of squared absolute
differences between weights from two iterations
