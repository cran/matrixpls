\usage{
  inner.path(S, W, inner.mod)
}
\arguments{
  \item{S}{Covariance matrix of the data.}

  \item{W}{Weight matrix, where the indicators are on
  colums and composites are on the rows.}

  \item{inner.mod}{A square matrix specifying the
  relationships of the composites in the model.}
}
\value{
  A matrix of unscaled inner weights \code{E} with the same
  dimesions as \code{inner.mod}.
}
\description{
  Calculates a set of inner weights based on the path
  scheme.
}
\details{
  In the path scheme, inner weights are based on regression
  estimates of the relationships between composites that
  are connected in the model specified in \code{inner.mod},
  and correlations for the inverse relationships. If a
  relationship is reciprocal, regression is used for both
  directions.

  Falls back to to identity scheme for composites that are
  not connected to any other composites.
